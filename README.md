[![Build Status](https://ci.freifunk-hennef.de/api/badges/Freifunk-Hennef/site/status.svg)](https://ci.freifunk-hennef.de/Freifunk-Hennef/site)  
ATTENTION: This branch is not recommended for productive use!

Every two weeks, we run an **automated** build from the actual master files of gluon, so we can checkout new features, hardware, and tweak our config to the possible changes. Given this, we recommend to not enable the autoupdater with this branch.

While we don't recommend the use of our exp branch, you may need it if you get some new hardware which is not in the [stable](https://github.com/Freifunk-Hennef/site/tree/stable) or [beta](https://github.com/Freifunk-Hennef/site/tree/beta) builds yet.
See the other [branches](https://github.com/Freifunk-Hennef/site/branches).
