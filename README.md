Freifunk-Hennef Gluon site config
=================================

[![Build Status](https://ci.freifunk-hennef.de/api/badges/Freifunk-Hennef/site/status.svg)](https://ci.freifunk-hennef.de/Freifunk-Hennef/site)  

Experimental
------------

ATTENTION: This branch is not recommended for productive use!

Every two weeks, we run an **automated** build from the actual master files of gluon, so we can checkout new features, hardware, and tweak our config to the possible changes. Given this, we recommend to **NOT** enable the autoupdater with this branch.

While we don't recommend the use of our experimental branch, you may need it if you get some new hardware which is not in the [stable](https://github.com/Freifunk-Hennef/site/tree/stable) or [beta](https://github.com/Freifunk-Hennef/site/tree/beta) builds yet.
See the other [branches](https://github.com/Freifunk-Hennef/site/branches).

If you are just looking for the firmware itself, see our [Downloader](http://images.freifunk-hennef.de/downloader/).

Beta
----

This branch is for testing new releases.

Given the quality of the gluon releases in the past, you may choose to use the beta firmware - if you want the new versions up to two weeks before we do the stable build.

However, there is a (very small) chance, that the release is not working correctly. If this could be an issue for you, see (and use) the [stable](https://github.com/Freifunk-Hennef/site/tree/stable) branch.

If you are just looking for the firmware itself, see our [Downloader](http://images.freifunk-hennef.de/downloader/).

Stable
------

Finally, this is our STABLE branch.

If you want to build the firmware for Freifunk Hennef yourself, then this is what you are looking for.

We consider a build as stable if there is a new release of gluon, and this release has passed the testing in the beta branch. This usually takes about two weeks after release.

If you need firmware for some bleeding edge router not included here (right now), you'll - maybe - have to try the [beta](https://github.com/Freifunk-Hennef/site/tree/beta) or [experimental](https://github.com/Freifunk-Hennef/site/tree/experimental) branches.

Data Privacy
------------
Since the whole world is talking about the new european regulations on data privacy, a few words from us.

We, as the community of Freifunk Hennef, do not save any data about you. Any data you provide during the setup of the node is saved right there, on YOUR node.

But to be clear, any information you provide there is considered "open access".

So while i.e. we dont even display this information on our [map](https://map.freifunk-hennef.de/) (besides the coordinates you provide, if any - it IS a map!), anyone visiting the site of your router will see any information your router provides.
